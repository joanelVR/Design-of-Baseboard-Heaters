# Design-of-Baseboard-Heaters
##### The purpose of this project was to design a baseboard heater and its mechanical heating system for a large apartment complex. The baseboard heaters consist of a copper pipe with square fins attached to its surface to enhance the heat transfer by extending the heat transfer surface area. The room, an enclosed area of 8m x 10m x 2.5m, was desired to maintain an inside temperature of 22 C during winter. The main objective was to create a thermally controlled environment capable of maintaining comfortable inside temperature at extreme winter temperatures. The design intent of the above system addressed in greater detail energy efficiency and simple operation. The following constraints/considerations were given for this project. 
  * Maintain the inside temperature @ 22 ºC during the winter
  * Only the north side of the apartment is exposed to outside cold temperature
  * Maintain the water temperature drop to be less than 4ºC as the water exits out the heater
  * Temperature of water to be maintained between 80 ºC-85 ºC
